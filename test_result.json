  "answer": "```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"The golden ratio (\u03c6) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 1.618. It has the algebraic form (1 + \u221a5)/2 and can be expressed as a continued fraction. Geometrically, it's represented by a golden rectangle where the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side equals the ratio of the sum of the sides to the longer side. Mathematically, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. The article provides basic representations of this number, but the content shown is limited to its definition and mathematical expressions.\",\n    \"confidence\":",
